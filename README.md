Ok story time. I like to teach ppl stuff but when im taking a webinar or workshop to a bunch of people they tend to hold back on doubts. So for the next webinar im gonna take im building an anonymous doubt asker kinda sorta thingy. The name is a work in progress if it wasnt obvious. Im aware of the existing ones but im trying to gamify it by allowing the attendees to also answer doubt to get points or idk idk have a cool ui ig. I NEED IDEAS. So if u have any cool idea to make this one better. help.
